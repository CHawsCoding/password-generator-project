# Secure Password Generator

For this project we are given completed HTML and CSS code and our job was to add to and edit the JavaScript code so that it would function properly when the user clicked the "Generate password" button. 

## Sources

Source code was from the bootcamp gitlab:
https://git.bootcampcontent.com/University-of-Utah/UofU-VIRT-FSF-PT-04-2023-U-LOLC/-/tree/main/03-JavaScript/02-Challenge

I used a Stack overflow article to help work through and debug the generate password function:
